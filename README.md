# Mulch_Estimate
 This is just a simple app that finds the cubic inches of an area that you want to fill with mulch
 and how much it will cost you and how many bags you will need
 Further iterations will include web scraping to keep prices current and 
also some options to select from numerous sources. 
As of right now, it is just static info other then the hypothetical information 
requested of the user. 
Mostly just made to further practice making and implementing a class and further practice 
will functions.
